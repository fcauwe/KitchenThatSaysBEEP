# KitchenThatSaysBEEP
Like a lot of daddy's my girl has an DUKTIG IKEA kitchen.
We gave it already nicer colours but we still missed some features.
Till I came along the following link made by [roaldh];

I felt in love with the concept, and love the beep.
I found also [Myles Eftos] that did the same with the microwave above:

I took best Ideas of both and made a remix.
